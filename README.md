# Zenith Hazard Report

This website is an integral part of the [Zenith Go](https://github.com/getzenith/zenith-go/tree/main) Hazard Detection System, designed to display captured images and hazard analysis results. Below is an explanation of the website's components and dependencies.

This initiative is part of the UXDG-490 course curriculum offered by the Savannah College of Art and Design. The project's objective is to conceptualize solutions for humanitarian needs and realize them through the process of prototyping.

## Functionality
The website's functionality is geared towards providing a detailed insight into hazard detection outcomes and their explanations, derived from the GPT-4 Vision Preview model. The following features are incorporated:

### Technical Features:
- Dynamic JSON Integration: The website dynamically retrieves and integrates JSON data generated by the GPT-4 Vision Preview model. This data includes hazard analysis results and associated reasons.
- Image Visualization: It facilitates the display of images uploaded by Zenith Go, offering users a visual representation of potential hazards identified within the captured images.
- Clear Presentation: The website organizes and presents hazard analysis results and reasons in a structured and comprehensible manner, ensuring ease of interpretation for users.
